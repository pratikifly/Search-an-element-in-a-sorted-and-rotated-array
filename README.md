# Search-an-element-in-a-sorted-and-rotated-array
An element in a sorted array can be found in O(log n) time via binary search. But suppose we rotate an ascending order sorted array at some pivot unknown to you beforehand. So for instance, 1 2 3 4 5 might become 3 4 5 1 2. Devise a way to find an element in the rotated array in O(log n) time.

For example-:

Input  : arr[] = {5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 1, 2, 3};
         key = 3
Output : Found at index 8

Input  : arr[] = {5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 1, 2, 3};
         key = 30
Output : Not found

Input : arr[] = {30, 40, 50, 10, 20}
        key = 10   
Output : Found at index 3

Approach-: 

The idea is to find the pivot point, divide the array in two sub-arrays and perform binary search.
The main idea for finding pivot is – for a sorted (in increasing order) and pivoted array, pivot element is the only element for which next element to it is smaller than it.
Using the above statement and binary search pivot can be found.
After the pivot is found out divide the array in two sub-arrays.
Now the individual sub – arrays are sorted so the element can be searched using Binary Search.
